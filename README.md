Love2d(https://love2d.org/) is a lua game engine. 
This was a small attempt to create a standardized way of creating and editing 'scenes' and objects within those scenes.
Barely any work has actually started, and this project is dead. But I am still interested in makeing love2d a more viable and easier to use engine.
